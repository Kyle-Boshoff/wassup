                Set up against the mountain, just a five minutes drive from Franschhoek village, you will find Stony Brook Vineyards. A working wine farm offering five, country style cottages. Rustic yet neat, the cottages are self-catering with kitchenettes that are equipped with basic cooking appliances suitable for cooking small, simple meals. All our water on the farm comes from a private, natural spring up in the mountain and is not only safe to drink but refreshing and pure. We supply 100% cotton bed linen, bath towels as well as pool towels in the summer months. The cottages are not air conditioned but there are standing fans.
            </p>
            <p class="additional-content">
                For the winter months the cottages have indoor fireplaces that keep the cottages cozy and warm.

                Come and enjoy the mountain view and lovely bird life from your patio while sipping a glass of Stony Brook wine.
